## Startup Time Benchmarking
Startup time is measured using [vim-startuptime](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-startuptime), automatically run via GitHub Actions on every push to main.

Benchmark results are published as a badge (top of this page) and as Markdown reports in the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/satorunooshie/23f13f7ddec85107fb2357f08f03ab1e).

- The colorscheme is [pairscolorscheme](https://github.com/satorunooshie/pairscolorscheme), a custom theme maintained in a separate repository.
- Configuration is tested primarily on macOS.
